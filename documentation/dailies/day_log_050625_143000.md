# Daily Development Log - June 5th, 2025

**Date:** 050625_143000  
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Not Complete)

## Stated Intent
Resolve JWT authentication issue where users were experiencing "error generating jwt token" message during sign-in, preventing successful authentication and access to the application.

## Background
The application was experiencing a critical authentication failure where users could not sign in due to a 500 Internal Server Error during JWT token generation. The error was manifesting as:
- "error generating jwt token" message in the app
- 500 status code on POST to `/auth/v1/token` endpoint
- Custom JWT claims (`custom_is_admin`) showing as undefined
- Authentication completely broken, preventing app usage

## Investigation & Findings

### Initial Diagnosis
- **Problem Location:** Custom access token hook (PostgreSQL function)
- **Root Cause:** PostgreSQL function `custom_access_token_hook` was returning `null` instead of proper JSON object
- **Auth Logs:** Showed "Hook ran successfully" but "Invalid type. Expected: object, given: null"

### Technical Deep Dive
1. **Function Testing:** Direct RPC calls to the function worked correctly, returning expected admin status
2. **Hook Configuration:** Verified in `supabase/config.toml` with correct URI format
3. **Database Permissions:** Applied `GRANT EXECUTE` to `supabase_auth_admin` role
4. **Return Format Issues:** Attempted multiple return formats (direct claims vs. app_metadata wrapper)

### Paths Taken

#### ‚ùå Failed Approaches
1. **PostgreSQL Hook Debugging:** Added extensive logging with `RAISE NOTICE` statements
2. **Return Format Variations:** Tried both `jsonb_build_object('custom_is_admin', value)` and wrapping in `app_metadata`
3. **Permission Fixes:** Applied additional grants to auth roles
4. **Multiple Function Rewrites:** Debug version, corrected version, permission-enhanced version

#### ‚úÖ Successful Resolution
**Client-Side Admin Check Implementation:**
- Disabled the problematic PostgreSQL hook in `supabase/config.toml`
- Modified `v0-elastic-habits/contexts/auth-context.tsx` to query `user_roles` table directly after authentication
- Implemented async admin status fetching during session initialization
- Added proper error handling and fallback behavior

## Technical Changes Made

### Configuration Changes
```toml
# supabase/config.toml
# Disabled PostgreSQL hook due to compatibility issues
# [auth.hook.custom_access_token]
# enabled = true
# uri = "pg-functions://postgres/public/custom_access_token_hook"
```

### Auth Context Updates
- Changed from JWT claim-based admin detection to database query approach
- Added async/await pattern for admin status fetching
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Maintained same public API for consuming components

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **PostgreSQL Hooks Complexity:** Auth hooks are sensitive to exact return formats and execution context
2. **Local vs. Remote Environment Issues:** Hook behavior may differ between local Supabase and production
3. **Client-Side Queries Reliability:** Direct database queries often more predictable than auth hooks
4. **Debugging Auth Hooks:** Limited visibility into hook execution context makes troubleshooting difficult

### Architecture Decisions
- **Favor Simplicity:** Client-side admin checks are more transparent and debuggable
- **Real-time Updates:** Database queries provide immediate reflection of permission changes
- **Error Resilience:** Explicit error handling vs. opaque hook failures

## Current Status: üö® INCOMPLETE

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issue Identified
**Problem:** All debugging and fixes were applied to LOCAL Supabase instance, but the application may still be pointing to the REMOTE/PRODUCTION Supabase instance.

**Evidence:**
- User reports still seeing "failure to generate JWT token error"
- Local testing showed successful authentication
- Likely environment variable mismatch

### Tomorrow's Action Items
1. **Verify Environment Configuration:**
   - Check `.env.local` and environment variables
   - Confirm Supabase URL and keys point to local instance
   - Validate auth context is using correct Supabase client

2. **Deploy Changes to Production:**
   - If using remote instance, apply the client-side admin check changes
   - Consider disabling the problematic hook in production
   - Test authentication flow in production environment

3. **Configuration Audit:**
   - Document environment setup process
   - Create environment validation script
   - Establish clear local vs. production workflows

## Files Modified
- `supabase/config.toml` - Disabled PostgreSQL hook
- `v0-elastic-habits/contexts/auth-context.tsx` - Implemented client-side admin check
- `supabase/migrations/20250606052259_create_user_roles_table.sql` - Created user roles migration
- Various test files (cleaned up)

## Database Migrations Applied
- `20240801120000_create_get_all_user_roles_function.sql`
- `20240801130000_create_custom_access_token_hook.sql`
- `20250606052259_create_user_roles_table.sql`

## Testing Results
‚úÖ Local Authentication: Working  
‚úÖ Admin Status Detection: Working  
‚úÖ JWT Generation: No errors locally  
‚ùå Production/Remote: Status unknown  

## Next Session Priority
üéØ **PRIMARY GOAL:** Resolve environment configuration mismatch and ensure production authentication works with the new client-side admin check approach.
