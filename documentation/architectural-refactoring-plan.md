# Architectural Refactoring Plan: Monolithic to Distributed Design

**Project**: Momentum Habits App  
**Created**: June 8, 2025  
**Status**: Active Development  
**Target Completion**: Q3 2025  

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic refactoring of the Momentum Habits application from a monolithic Next.js application to a distributed, service-oriented architecture. The refactoring will be executed in four progressive phases to minimize disruption while preparing for future scalability.

## Current Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Server-side functions in Next.js API routes
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Deployment**: Vercel (monolithic deployment)

## Target Architecture

- **Frontend**: React SPA with separate deployment
- **API Gateway**: Express.js/Fastify API server
- **Microservices**: Dedicated services (Auth, Habits, Analytics, Admin)
- **Database**: Maintained Supabase with service-level abstractions
- **Message Queue**: Redis/RabbitMQ for inter-service communication
- **Deployment**: Containerized services with independent scaling

## Critical Stability Fixes (Completed) ‚úÖ

**Timeline**: Recently Completed  
**Goal**: Resolve authentication loops, data fetching failures, and client-side instability issues.

### Application Stability Issues Resolved
- [x] **Fixed `useHabits` infinite loop**: Removed `user` and `session` from `fetchHabits` dependency array
- [x] **Implemented proper auth redirects**: Added `useRouter` redirect logic in `HabitsPage` 
- [x] **Removed dashboard timeout bug**: Deleted `loadingTimeout` logic causing false logouts
- [x] **Fixed dependency management**: Switched from `npm` to `pnpm` for proper package resolution
- [x] **Replaced faulty API middleware**: Implemented proper Supabase SSR middleware using `@supabase/ssr`
- [x] **Resolved JWT validation issues**: Removed custom `jose` middleware blocking API requests

### Technical Debt Addressed
- [x] **Package manager consistency**: Ensured `pnpm` usage throughout project
- [x] **Authentication flow stability**: Fixed client-side auth state management loops
- [x] **API request handling**: Restored proper server-side authentication validation
