## Project Background

Momentum is a modern habit tracking application built on the "Elastic Habits" concept, which allows users to define flexible habits with multiple activities and achievement levels. The app enables users to create habits with up to 3 different activities, each having 3 achievement tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold), providing flexibility in how users approach their habit formation.

- **Icons:** Lucide React


### Backend

- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with JWT sessions
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage for user avatars
- **Security:** Row-level security (RLS) policies

6. Admin-only navigation access

5. **User Interface**

1. Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
2. Dark/light mode toggle
3. Toast notifications for user feedback

5. Accessible design with proper ARIA labels

6. **Data Management**

1. User data export/import capabilities
2. Data retention settings
3. Clear all data functionality
4. Database scripts for user data management

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

- `habits` - User habits with activities and levels
- `habit_tracking` - Daily tracking entries
- `user_roles` - Admin status and account management
- Storage buckets for user avatars


### Key Relationships

- Users â†’ Habits (one-to-many)
- Habits â†’ Tracking (one-to-many)
- Users â†’ Roles (one-to-one)


## Current Work Items & Requirements

### ðŸ”„ In Progress / Pending Implementation

1. **End-of-Day Habit Reminders**

1. **Requirement:** Toast notification at 5:00 PM local time if habits are untracked
2. **Specifications:**

1. Check user's local time periodically
2. Show persistent toast requiring manual dismissal
3. Only show once per day (prevent multiple notifications)
4. Include "Track Now" button linking to tracking page
5. User-configurable reminder time in settings


3. **Status:** Implementation provided but not yet integrated

2. **Enhanced Tracking Page Behavior**

1. **Requirement:** When habit already logged, default activity selector to logged activity
2. **Specifications:**

1. Show checkmark on tracked activities in tabs
2. Outline tracked level buttons (black outline in light mode, white/gray in dark mode)
3. Prevent multiple level selections per activity
4. Maintain visual feedback for completed items


3. **Admin System Enhancements**

1. **Requirement:** Only admin users should see admin page access
2. **Current Status:** âœ… Implemented
3. **Additional Requirements:**

1. User activity tracking and reporting
2. Bulk user management operations
3. System-wide analytics and insights


## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

- Supabase Auth handles user sessions
- Custom AuthContext provides user state management
- Admin status checked via `user_roles` table
- Disabled users automatically signed out on login attempt


### Habit Tracking Logic

- Unique constraint: `(habit_id, date, activity_index, level_index)`
- Upsert operations for tracking updates
- Real-time state synchronization with database
- Optimistic UI updates with error rollback


### Security Implementation

- Row-level security on all user data tables
- Admin-only policies for user management
- CSRF protection and input validation
- Secure avatar upload with file type restrictions


## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- Supabase account and project
- Vercel account (for deployment)


### Environment Variables Required

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
```

### Database Setup Scripts

Located in `/scripts/` directory:

- `create-habits-tables.sql` - Core habit tables
- `create-user-roles-table.sql` - Admin system
- `create-avatar-storage.sql` - File storage setup
- `make-user-admin.sql` - Admin user creation


## Known Issues & Considerations

### Resolved Issues

- âœ… Infinite recursion in user_roles policies
- âœ… Navigation issues between pages
- âœ… Email confirmation redirect URLs
- âœ… Duplicate habit tracking entries


### Current Considerations

- End-of-day reminder implementation needs integration
- Performance optimization for large tracking datasets
- Mobile app considerations for future development
- Offline functionality requirements


## Next Steps for New Contributors

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Integrate End-of-Day Reminders**

1. Add provided reminder components to main layout
2. Update settings page with reminder configuration
3. Test notification timing and persistence

2. **Complete Tracking Page Enhancements**

1. Implement visual feedback for tracked activities
2. Add proper outlining for completed levels
3. Ensure proper tab defaulting behavior

3. **Admin System Polish**

1. Add bulk operations for user management
2. Implement system-wide analytics
3. Create admin activity logging


### Future Enhancements

- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Data export/import functionality
- Social features (habit sharing, challenges)
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Mobile app development
