## Original Prompt
I don't see the notifications at the end of day happening or taking place.  Tell me and if at all possible,  generate a separate downloadable file for how to implement the following:

a) need a toast reminder on the site, whereas if by 5:00pm local time to the user, there is at least one habit without any activities with logged levels, the user is made aware.  Require dismissing the "toast" (toward the top of the page).

### End-of-Day Habit Reminder Implementation

I'll explain how to implement the 5:00 PM habit reminder toast notification and provide a downloadable implementation file.

## How It Works

The implementation will:

1. Check the user's local time periodically
2. At 5:00 PM, check if any habits haven't been tracked for the day
3. Show a persistent toast notification that requires manual dismissal
4. Remember if the notification has been shown today (to avoid showing it multiple times)


## Implementation Guide

I've created a comprehensive solution for implementing the 5:00 PM habit reminder feature. Here's how it works:

### Key Features

1. **Automatic Time Check**: The system checks the user's local time and shows a reminder at 5:00 PM if there are untracked habits.
2. **Persistent Toast**: The notification requires manual dismissal and won't disappear automatically.
3. **Smart Tracking**: The system identifies which habits haven't been tracked for the day.
4. **One-Time Reminder**: The reminder only shows once per day, even if the user refreshes the page.
5. **Configurable Settings**: Users can enable/disable reminders and change the reminder time in the settings page.


### How to Implement

1. **Add the Reminder Component**:

1. Add the `EnhancedHabitReminder` component to your app's layout
2. This component runs in the background and doesn't render anything visible

2. **Update the Settings Page**:

1. Replace the existing notifications card with the new `ReminderSettings` component
2. This gives users control over their reminder preferences

3. **Test the Implementation**:

1. The reminder will show at 5:00 PM local time
2. For testing, you can temporarily modify the time check as described in the guide


### Technical Details

- The system uses `localStorage` to remember if a reminder has been shown today
- It checks the time every minute using a `setInterval`
- The reminder includes a "Track Now" button that takes users directly to the tracking page
- All settings are persisted in `localStorage` for a seamless experience


The downloadable files include everything you need, including a detailed implementation guide that explains how to customize the feature further if needed.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
