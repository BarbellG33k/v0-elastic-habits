# Troubleshooting Navigation Issues

## Navigation Breaks After Error

If you encounter navigation issues after a database error (such as "stuck" URLs or non-responsive links), here are some troubleshooting steps:

### For Users

1. **Clear the browser cache and cookies** for the application domain
2. **Force reload** the page using Ctrl+F5 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. Try opening the application in an **incognito/private browsing** window
4. If issues persist, **contact support** with details about the error

### For Developers

1. **Check browser console** for errors that might explain navigation issues
2. Verify that **auth state** is correctly managed after errors occur
3. Implement **error boundaries** to catch and gracefully handle unexpected errors
4. Consider adding a **global error state** that triggers navigation resets when errors occur
5. Add **diagnostic logging** to track user sessions and navigation paths

## Preventative Measures

To prevent navigation issues after errors:

1. Add error handling in the authentication context to properly reset state
2. Implement a navigation guard that detects stale routes
3. Use client-side routing that gracefully handles authentication state changes
4. Add automatic retry logic for failed API calls
5. Implement periodic checks to verify authentication status
