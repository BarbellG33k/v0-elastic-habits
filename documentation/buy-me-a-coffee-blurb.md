# About Momentum

Hi there! I'm the creator of Momentum, a habit tracking app designed to help you build consistent routines with flexibility in mind.

Momentum is built on the "elastic habits" concept, which recognizes that life isn't always predictable. Some days you have more energy and time than others. Instead of the rigid "all or nothing" approach of traditional habit trackers, Momentum lets you define multiple activities and achievement levels for each habit.

For example, on busy days, you might only complete a 10-minute workout (Bronze level), while on days with more free time, you might achieve a full 30-minute session (Gold level). This flexibility helps maintain your streak even when life gets hectic.

The app is completely free and open-source. Your support through "Buy Me a Coffee" helps cover hosting costs and enables continued development of new features.

Thank you for your support, and I hope Momentum helps you build lasting habits that adapt to your life!
