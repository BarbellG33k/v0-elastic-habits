Yes, you can create a new branch off main right now to commit these changes. This is actually a good practice since we're making several HTML structure changes that should be tested together. Here's what I recommend:

1. Create and switch to a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b fix/html-nesting-issues
```

2. Make all the necessary changes to fix the HTML nesting issues:
   - Update the track page to fix the date display
   - Update the about popup to fix the dialog description
   - Fix any other components with similar issues

3. Test the changes thoroughly to ensure nothing breaks

4. Once everything is working, commit the changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve HTML nesting validation issues"
```

5. Push the branch and create a pull request:
```bash
git push origin fix/html-nesting-issues
```

This approach is better than committing directly to main because:
1. It isolates these structural changes
2. Allows for proper testing before merging
3. Provides a clear way to revert if needed
4. Follows good git workflow practices

Would you like me to help you implement these changes in the new branch?
