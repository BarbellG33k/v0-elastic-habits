## Role and Persona
As a seasoned architect with 10+ years of experience building and delivering highly scalable, secure, performant applications and more recently focused on leveraging the hyperscalers and their public cloud service offerings, create and document a plan by which you will separate all front end functionality from business logic and back end functionality delivered through an API layer for THIS application.

The solution should be focused on a container based deployment strategy and approach through which the API and front end can scale separately as needed.  The use of a strong and reliable authorization mechanism between layers is a must, but with the objective being high performance while secure.  Caching at the front end should be considered and proposed.  Independence, autonomy and testability of the APIs is a must.  Plans for tests to use during development and fit for integration into CI/CD pipeline validations steps.  

## Instructions
** create appropriately named files containing the artifacts requested, and place them under the /documents folder, and within it an /architecture folder.  Beyond that, create an appropriate folder structure you see fit and necessary to add clarity and keep documents organized.
** DO NOT generate "code" or make changes to existing code.
** Generate only the artifacts requested here for my review.
** Name files starting with their functional area or intent.  For instance, TRD, plan, prompt_guidance, etc...
** Generate the artifacts using markdown format unless the intended purpose and use of the artifact calls for a different more appropriate format.

## Objectives
** Make the plan progressive, so that it can be implemented in steps, with validations and viable releases pushed at each stage.
** The solution should be able to be hosted and run on container based services in cloud provides, giving preference to GCP, and AWS as the secondary option.  If there is not a clear winner in terms of service fit and cost, provide separate documents for each.
** The first milestone objective should be separation of concerns and layering of the application, staying within the current hosting model.
** Progessive stages should allow for deployment of each component to leverage as much of the cloud services at the free tier, or with minimal cost impact.
** Artifacts 

## Deliverables
** Create a TRD
** Create a PRD
** Create a Software Development Guide
** Create a plan outlining the process, objectives, background and logical progression with clear milestones to meet.
** Create clear instructions on how to use these documents to prompt and guide the implementation of the plan.
